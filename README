---------------
I created this project to have a simple way to share my daugther's pictures (Olivia => Golivia, I probably deserve a price for originality) with the family on a self-hosted solution
I don't really want to use flickr, don't want to install apps to spy on me, just want a simple "add to online gallery" functionality and want to play a bit with golang :)

I originally started with native golang library to resize images, then got hit by a bug on my camera (truncated data inside jpg)
I then switched to imagemagick hoping it would cope with this problem, but it did not (so now I could just benchmark for fun and go back to pure golang for simplicity)


The progress:
- models : 80 %
- api : 80 %
- static generation / html templates : 0 % need some clean css
