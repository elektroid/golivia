This small server once configured allow to manipulate virtual photos albums.
It is intented to be used from a mobile phone app to to post photos, and then statically generate galleries optionaly proteced by .htaccess

I created this project to have a simple way to share my daugther's pictures (Olivia => Golivia, I probably deserve a price for originality) with the family on a self-hosted solution
I don't really want to use flickr, don't want to install apps to spy on me, just want a simple "add to online gallery" functionality and want to play a bit with golang :)


The progress:
- models : 50 %
- api : 0 %
- static generation / html templates : 0 %


ETA for a proof-of-concept: April 2016
