TODO

** Cleaning current version
-make a page to list albums
-make a simple interface to edit properties of albums

#nice to have
-add a cover photo for albums


** Making galleries by dates (so we can later just massively upload and let the server sort it for us)
-use some exif parser to store dates on photos, maybe https://godoc.org/github.com/rwcarlsen/goexif/exif#example-Decode
-check if Time.time works ok with sqlite


** Making a client that will scan photo and upload all to servers
-take basedir, list all files and create associated md5sum
-post to servers after checking md5 does not exists
-make a better algo for that (sounds a lot like rsync...)

**Tagging photos
-Could be nice to add multiple tags with people, actions ... (but will I ever take the time to tag)
